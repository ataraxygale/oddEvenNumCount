# 📝 oddEvenNumCount
Odd or Even Number Counter
- A simple Python program that takes an integer input from the user, counts the number of odd vs even numbers entered and outputs the results.

# ♾️ How it Works
- User is prompted to enter an integer
- User will be continuously prompted to enter more integers to be counted until 0 is entered
- Input 0 to stop the program
- Error handling: Will provide feedback if input fails the input validation check with input besides an integer

# 🧮 Sample Output
- Enter a number or type 0 to stop: 3
- Enter a number or type 0 to stop: 4
- Enter a number or type 0 to stop: 0
- Odd numbers count: 1
- Even numbers count: 1

# 🧠 Why I Made This
- I decided to upload my small coding projects along the way to my future projects to document my coding journey. I value fundamental coding structures, and am genuinely interested to see how my structures evolve over time.
