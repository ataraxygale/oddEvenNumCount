Odd or Even Number Counter
-A simple Python program that takes an integer input from the user, counts the number of odd vs even numbers entered and outputs the results.

- User will be continuously prompted to enter more integers to be counted until 0 is entered
- Input 0 to stop the program
- Error handling: Will provide feedback if input fails the input validation check with input besides an integer

# 🧮 Sample Output
Enter a number or type 0 to stop: 3
Enter a number or type 0 to stop: 4
Enter a number or type 0 to stop: 0
